## üìÅ Project Structure

```
/whatsapp-nodejs-chatbot/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app.js # Main Express application and bot logic
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json # Node.js dependencies and scripts
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .env # Environment variables (API keys, tokens)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ persona.json # Customizable AI personality settings
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md # This file
```


## üöÄ Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

2. **Initialize Node.js project and install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm init -y
    npm install express axios dotenv morgan @google/generative-ai
    ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables:**  
    Create a `.env` file in the project root directory (do **not** commit this file if it contains sensitive keys):

    ```bash
    GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE" # Free tier: 1500 requests/month
    WASENDER_API_TOKEN="YOUR_WASENDER_API_TOKEN_HERE" # $6/month subscription
    PORT=5001 # Optional: default is 5001
    ```

    Replace placeholders with your actual API keys.

4. **Create or customize `persona.json`** to define your bot‚Äôs personality and behavior.

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Running the Application

### 1. Development Mode

Start the Express server locally:

```bash
node app.js
```

The app will listen on `http://0.0.0.0:5001/` (or the port set in your `.env`).

### 2. Using ngrok for Webhook Testing

WaSenderAPI requires a publicly accessible URL for webhook events. Use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to expose your local server:

```bash
ngrok http 5001
```


Copy the generated public URL (e.g., `https://xxxx.ngrok.io`) and set your webhook URL in WaSenderAPI dashboard as:

```bash
https://xxxx.ngrok.io/webhook
```

### 3. Production Deployment

Use a process manager like [PM2](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/) or run behind a reverse proxy (Nginx) for production.

Example with PM2:

```bash
npm install pm2 -g
pm2 start app.js --name whatsapp-bot
```

## üîÑ WaSenderAPI Webhook Configuration

- Log in to your WaSenderAPI dashboard.  
- Connect your phone number to a session.  
- Set or update the webhook URL to your public endpoint (e.g., ngrok URL or production URL) with `/webhook` path.  
- Enable only the **messages.upsert** event.  
- Save changes.

## üìù Customizing Your Bot's Personality

Edit the `persona.json` file to customize the AI persona and base prompt. For example:

```bash
{
"name": "WhatsApp Assistant",
"base_prompt": "You are a helpful and concise AI assistant replying in a WhatsApp chat. Do not use Markdown formatting. Keep your answers short, friendly, and easy to read. If your response is longer than 3 lines, split it into multiple messages using \n every 3 lines. Each \n means a new WhatsApp message. Avoid long paragraphs or unnecessary explanations.",
"description": "You are a friendly WhatsApp assistant. Keep your responses concise and clear."
}
```

Note: This influences how Gemini AI generates replies.

## üìä Logging and Error Handling

- Uses `morgan` for HTTP request logging.  
- Logs detailed info and errors to the console.  
- Customize logging as needed for production (file logs, external services).


## üí° Why This Solution?

This chatbot offers a cost-effective way to deploy an AI-powered WhatsApp bot without the high costs of WhatsApp Business API. By combining WaSenderAPI's affordable $6/month subscription with Google's free Gemini API tier, you get a powerful, customizable chatbot solution at a fraction of the cost of enterprise alternatives.
